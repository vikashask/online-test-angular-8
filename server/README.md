## task

## Create a User-Product portal

1. Landing page should have login screen : Login - A register user will login with his credentials Or user will sign up

2. Once a user login successfully, then

> user should be able to see list of the products on the landing page and also search for specific products.

> user should be able to create new products

> user should be able to edit or delete owned products.

> user should be able to edit own details.

> user should be able to see other user details but cannot edit or delete

> user should be able to see products created by other user but cannot edit or delete
              
3. Error Handling implementation for the above 

REST API (services) details:

## CRUD operation for User
> create User

> list users

> get single user resource by Id

> edit user

> delete user

## CRUD operation for Advertisement
> create product

> list products

> get single product resource by Id

> edit products

> delete products


### Expectation from the candidate:

> Preferred solution would have the rest api implemention using nodeJs, KOA JS/ Express JS etc. or if that is not possible it can be 
mocked using the axios.

> The portal must be created using react, redux and thunk, Custom CSS / CSS framework, responsive design, and unit test cases covering 
all scenarios.

> Use all best practices (production level code quality).

> Include README file.
